# Vial

Why do I keep coming back to cheminformatics? I don't know what I hope to get from this...

Vial's purpose is to act as a database for molecules, with fragmentation done to save memory for redundant fragments and speed up subgraph queries. The focus is on the molecular graphs and their topology rather than geometry, and maybe if I figure out what I'm doing, I'll see if I can figure out QSAR.
